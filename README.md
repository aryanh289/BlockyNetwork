# BlockyNetwork
A decentralised social media prototype application that runs on ethereum.

This is a social network prototype application where user can create there own post, see other's post and they can also tip other's great post. 
<br>which is desined using react and babel web-pack, and backed by solid ethereum blockchain network, <br>
and behind the scenes we are using solidity for writting the business and logic. Web3.js comes really handy while joinin the fronend and the backend <br>

For running this project, we have to install ganache (a temporary ethereum network with min 10 nodes), add the project file `truffle.config` and run <br>
this command: 
0. `npm install` & `npm run start`<br>
1. `truffle compile`    <br>
2. `truffle migrate`<br>
3. `truffle test`<br>
4. Add chrome extendion `metamask` and create an ID. <br>
5. Add few accounts in your metamask, to try the application.<br>
6. Post anything, it will ask for ethereum, pay and see the post. Boom!!<br>
<br>
I learned all of these stuffs from Dapp university. Thanks to that!
